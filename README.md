Quite literally there's no point in using it as KeePass exists, this project is mainly here just so I can have a look back at it later on & save it
somewhere safe as a memory.

Used MySQL, pysimplegui, pyperclip for the project as I mainly wanted to focus on every other part of the project, but ended up with no encryption & only
source of authentification being a password stored in a nearby file.

Possible improvements would include recoding the entire thing in C# and using its forms as a better GUI method, adding encryption + salting & generally more
features. Again, KeePass exists and already does everything & more though.
